    Look for apricots that are slightly underripe so they'll stand up to the
    heat, or you can substitute two medium peaches. We like the smooth texture
    and intense flavor of imported Parma prosciutto in this dish.Combine 1/2 cup
    warm water and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer with dough hook attached;
    let stand 5 minutes or until bubbly.

            When a dish has an ingredient that is also a signature flavor in a
            wine, go with the match. For this pizza, it's viognier, a
            full-bodied, aromatic white that often announces itself with apricot
            aromas. Try the Bridlewood 2008 Reserve Viognier from California's
            central coast ($24). Under its stone fruit flavors lurk layers of
            citrus-tangerine and tangy grapefruit-with an elegant honeysuckle
            wrap. Rich enough to love the prosciutto on the pizza, the wine has
            lovely acidity that works well with goat cheese, too. -Sara
            Schneider.
